00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.939
When we try to understand the

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.919
concept of self-compassion,

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.779
it can be helpful to first think of

4
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.609
compassion - what it is

5
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.630
and how it feels.

6
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.229
Compassion can be defined as

7
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.209
feelings of kindness towards,

8
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.189
and a desire to help, someone who's

9
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.190
suffering.

10
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.689
Imagine how you'd react if a good

11
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.399
friend told you about some upsetting

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.139
news they'd received and they were

13
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.250
clearly distressed.

14
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.699
If your reaction was to feel

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.799
concerned and want to help them,

16
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.800
that's compassion.

17
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.149
Self-compassion is applying the same

18
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.679
sense of loving concern to

19
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.779
ourselves, especially at times

20
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.619
when life is hard and stressful.

21
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.419
Most of us are great at feeling and

22
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.819
acting on our compassion for others,

23
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.619
but when it comes to ourselves, we

24
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.989
can be tough and uncaring.

25
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.699
Sometimes we don't even realise we

26
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.259
are suffering because we're so

27
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.179
focused on other people's needs or

28
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.180
getting things done.

29
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.109
Self-compassion is also about

30
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.939
taking a balanced and mindful

31
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.499
perspective of things.

32
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.299
Seeing the bigger picture beyond a

33
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.279
moment of suffering, instead

34
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.348
of ignoring our pain or exaggerating

35
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.349
it.

36
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.929
When we are compassionate to

37
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.879
ourselves, we recognise that

38
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.469
suffering is part of the human

39
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.104
experience that connects us all,

40
00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:14.919
rather than something that

41
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.229
isolates us or means we are flawed

42
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.230
or unworthy.
