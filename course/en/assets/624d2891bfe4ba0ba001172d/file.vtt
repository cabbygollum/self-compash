00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.279
Hi, I'm Cat, and I'm gonna

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.659
show you some soothing touch

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.519
exercises you can use to

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520
calm your nervous system.

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.359
The first is to simply put your hand

6
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.859
over your heart.

7
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.419
You can experiment with how much

8
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.069
pressure feels good here.

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.899
Some people like firm pressure or

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.699
even a fist with the other hand over

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.809
the top.

12
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.699
Other people like me, like a gentler

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.859
touch and even some soft,

14
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.860
soothing motion.

15
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.389
Next, you can try putting your hand

16
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.249
over your stomach, or two

17
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.079
hands on your stomach, or one

18
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.729
on your chest and one on your

19
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.869
stomach.

20
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.519
Play around with these to see which

21
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.600
feels best for you.

22
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.749
The next is a self hug.

23
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.159
Where you simply wrap your arms

24
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.259
around yourself and give yourself

25
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.089
a big squeeze, as if you

26
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.679
would a friend who is having a tough

27
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.639
day.

28
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.499
Lots of people find this really

29
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.269
comforting and containing.

30
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.919
And it can be quite discreet if you

31
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.299
want to try it out in a meeting.

32
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.869
The last one, which is my favourite,

33
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.479
is to gently caress your skin.

34
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.939
I like to run my fingertips really

35
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.609
lightly across the skin on my face

36
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.889
or down the back of my neck,

37
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.119
and even through my hair.

38
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.329
Your skin's full of nerve endings

39
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.129
that you can use to send a signal to

40
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.589
your brain that you're safe

41
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.539
and you can relax, and

42
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.279
all those stress hormones can melt

43
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.400
away.

44
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:27.289
So there you have it.

45
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.999
Those are some exercises that use

46
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.619
the power of the body to calm the

47
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.620
brain.
