Dear Mark,

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.929
I'm writing to you because I know

3
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.219
you're really stressed out about

4
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.989
restructure and uncertainty of your

5
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.099
role.

6
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.269
I'm sorry you have to go through

7
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.129
this. It's awful not knowing

8
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.329
if your job is secure and you're

9
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.429
powerless to do anything about it.

10
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.289
I hope you know, I have total faith

11
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.269
in your ability to get through this.

12
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.759
You're smart, talented, experienced

13
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.049
and creative.

14
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.549
You'll bounce back no matter what

15
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.550
happens.

16
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.039
I'm wondering if you've thought

17
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.869
about dedicating a bit more time to

18
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.999
your own self-care.

19
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.229
If you do some of the things you

20
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.269
really enjoy more often, it'll

21
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.679
help with the stress.

22
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.599
Please know I'm proud of you and

23
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.799
I'm always here for you.
